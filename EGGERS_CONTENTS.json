How do we build our own server with some simple **GET** and **POST** request functionality?\n\n## To Do Today\n\n* ### [Warmup](#warmup)\n* ### [Server Basics](#server-basics)\n* ### [Simple GET Requests](#simple-get-requests)\n* ### [Routing](#routing)\n* ### [Simple POST Requests](#simple-post-requests)\n* ### [Serving a full webpage](#serving-a-full-webpage)\n* ### [Serving JSON content](#serving-json-content)\n\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"Servers 101","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"A quick introduction to serving and routing in NodeJS","idx":2},"warmup":{"content":"# Warmup\n\nLet's begin with a few short exercises.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nCreate a new folder.\n\n```bash\nmkdir node-server && cd node-server\n```\n\nInitialize your project inside this folder.\n\n```bash\nnpm init\n```\n**Remember** to follow the steps **NPM init** provides for you! **WINDOWS** users, after the last prompt, if process does not quit, simply **Ctrl+D** to exit.\n\nCreate an **index.js** file for Node\n\n```bash\ntouch index.js\n```\n\nCreate a folder called **public**.\n\n```bash\nmkdir public\n```\n\nInside your **public** folder, create the usual files and folders you would for a regular website.\n\n```bash\ncd public\nmkdir styles js\ntouch index.html js/app.js styles/main.css\n```\n\nOpen up your entire **node-server** project on sublime, write some sample code in your **index.js** file, and test run to ensure it is working fine.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nThere are a few modules that we will be working with tonight.\n\nInstall each module as follows:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev nodemon\nnpm install --save cookies\n```\n\n**Question**: what is the point of **--save**? How about **--save-dev**?\n\n","idx":3},"server-basics":{"content":"","idx":4},"simple-get-requests":{"content":"","idx":5},"routing":{"content":"","idx":6},"simple-post-requests":{"content":"","idx":7},"serving-a-full-webpage":{"content":"","idx":8},"serving-json-content":{"content":"","idx":9},"__list__":["home","title","desc","warmup","server-basics","simple-get-requests","routing","simple-post-requests","serving-a-full-webpage","serving-json-content"]}
